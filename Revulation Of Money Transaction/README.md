### Features
1. Transaction Date
2. Transaction Mode
3. Credited Amount
4. Debited Amount
5. Total Transactions
6. Debit & Credit By Month

## Analysis

My goal is to demonstrate how transactions mode are changing efiicently from barter system to look how we relied on online transaction, how it has make our life easy in terms of  money transaction. I used some of Microsoft Excel inbuilt functions to draw meaning full insights.
 In the end I complied it onto a single-report using Power BI Dashboard (shown below).

### Objective

What is the most transaction mode (online/offline) ? The task is to demonstrate about how revulationary changes impact on our transaction system also if we look ourseleves, how we relied on online transaction to our day to day life. I'm able to do this by using the data I already have.


### Key Findings

Technology are growing rapidly as well as revulation of money, in an year I have transacted 1.3 million indian currency over 886 transactions. Looking to the transactions we can see how transactions are made through multiple way from debit and credit transactions. Most highest transacation are made by "Unified Payments Interface" (UPI).

However barter system faced multiple problems and make transactions increasingly complex, to overcome this kind of issue people use commodity money also this method not a good way to exchanging things. Around 600 BCE ancient civilizations introduced standardized coins made of precious metals like Gold & Silver this innovation streamlined trade, fueled commerce, and spurred economic development across vast empires. Then in the 7th century CE,china devloped a methodology known as paper money. Initally as compare to precious metals, these banknotes eventually became representative of the trust placed in the issuing authority, when paper money derives its value from governmental orders and civilance acceptance. This methodology spread across the world and lead to establish of banking system.

The advantage of digital transaction starting later increase transaction speeds based on blockchain technology, these also offer secure transparent, and borderless transactions.
